- File creation detection working correctly
- Metadata extraction using os.stat() functional
- Logging system operational

Test Cases Executed:

1. Initial directory scan
   - Result: Successfully detected existing files

2. File creation detection
   - Created: test3.txt, test4.txt, test5.txt
   - Result: All new files detected within 5 seconds

3. Metadata extraction
   - Verified: filename, size, permissions, timestamps
   - Result: All metadata correctly extracted

4. Log file generation
   - Location: logs/directory_changes.log
   - Result: Detailed logs created succefully

Linux Commands Used:
