===Directory Monitoring Module===

Test Summary:

- File creation detection implmented and tested
- File deletion detection implemented and tested
- File modification detection implemented and tested
- All metadata changes tracked correctly
- Before and after values logged for modifications

Test Cases Executed:

1. File Creation Detection
   - Created: test_creation.txt, batch4.txt, batch5.txt, batch6.txt, test2_creation.txt, test3.txt, test10.txt
   - Result: All new files detected immediately
   - Metadata: Complete extraction verified

2. File Modification Detection:
   - Test: Size change (16--> 21 bytes) 
   - Test: Permission change (664 --> 644) / (664 --> 777)
   - Test: Timestamp changes
   - Result: All modifications detected and logged with old to new values

3. File Deletion Detection:
   - Deleted: batch3.txt, batch5.txt, test2_creation.txt, test3.txt
   - Result: Deletions detected and logged with timestamp

Verification Methods:

- Used stat command to verify metadata accuracy
- Used ls -l to verify permissions
- Compared Python output with Linux command output
- All data matched correctly

Code Implementation:

Functions added:

- detect_file_deletion(): Detects removed files
- detect_file)_modification(): Compares file metadata
- log_file_deletion(): Records deletion events
- log_file_modification(): Records changes with before and after values

Modified functions:

- get_directory_snapshot(): Now returns full metadata
- main(): Integrated all three detection types

Linux Commands Used:

- stat: Verify file metadata
- ls -l: Check permissions and size
- chmod: Test permission changes
- rm: Test file deletion
- echo >>: Test file modification

Python Commands Used:

- Set operations for file comparison
- Dictionary metadata storage
- Timestamp comparison with tolerance
- Error handling for file operations

Test Results:

/ Creation detection accurate
/ Deletion detection accurate
/ Modification detection accurate
  - Size changes: /
  - Permission changes: /
  - Timestamp changes: /

Performance:

- Check interval: 5 seconds
- Detection latency: < 5 seconds

Next Steps:

- Integration with Student B module which is system performance
- Combined reporting
- Final testing and optimization
